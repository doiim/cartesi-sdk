# Deroll tamplate to be used with Cartesi SDK

This is a [Sunodo](https://sunodo.io) template for Cartesi applications that use the [Deroll](https://github.com/tuler/deroll) framework.

## Usage

First be sure that you have sunodo installed on your machine. You will also be required to have Docker installed.

```sh
sunodo build
```

After generating the Docker machine files you can just run the Cartesi Machine using:

```sh
sunodo run
```

## Troubleshooting

Check the command `sunodo doctor` to check if the machine has all requirements to run Sunodo.
