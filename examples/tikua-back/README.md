# Deroll template to be used with Tikua SDK

This is a [Cartesi CLI](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.3/quickstart/) template for Cartesi applications that use the [Deroll](https://github.com/tuler/deroll) framework.

## Usage

First be sure that you have Cartesi installed on your machine. You will also be required to have Docker installed.

```sh
cartesi build
```

After generating the Docker machine files you can just run the Cartesi Machine using:

```sh
cartesi run
```

## Troubleshooting

Check the command `cartesi doctor` to check if the machine has all requirements to run Cartesi Rollups.
