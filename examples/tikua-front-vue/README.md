# Vue.JS Client Example - Tikua - Cartesi SDK

This example project demonstrates how to use the Tikua client in a JavaScript frontend application. The project uses [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) and includes an example of how to interact with a dApp deployed on the network. It provides a simple user interface to send inputs to the dapp, drink potions, and check the hero status.
